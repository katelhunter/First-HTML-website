		<h1>Welcome to Nebraska No Kill Canine Rescue</h1>
		<p><strong>Nebraska No Kill Canine Rescue</strong> (NNKCR) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that was originally formed in 2010 by a handful of volunteers who wanted to provide a foster-based no-kill option for all dogs regardless of breed. We utilize a network of foster homes who volunteer their time. To date, Nebraska No Kill has rehomed more than 400 dogs, with a success rate of 97 percent on adoptions. Nebraska No Kill Canine Rescue strives to collaborate with other local rescues and has developed a strong relationship with the Capital Humane Society and other shelters across the state, often working together on hard-to-place dogs.</p>
		<p>It’s pretty simple. The more fosters and funding we have, the more dogs we can save! Those two factors are the keys to our whole operation. Our network is growing, but the influx of dogs in need of a foster home continues. Fostering is a great way to help a dog along in his or her life’s journey with no long-term commitments and little or no financial obligation. Foster dogs are fully vetted prior to placement, and medical expenses are paid for by Nebraska No Kill Canine Rescue until an adopter is found. Consider opening your home and your heart to a foster dog, and we’ll work hard to find a great match!</p>
