		<p>Jasmine is the life of the party! She loves playing with toys! She does request that her new home have a giant toy box full of toys for her to play with. But one of Jasmine's pet peeves is running! She thinks there are better ways of exercising than running, like going for long walks, or playing with toys. She doesn't think anyone should partake in running around and will bark at anyone who does.</p>

			<h3>Adopt Brinkley</h3>

		<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/22/8c/ce228c1c1610c1bfb4b06bf9e513049a.jpg" alt="Brinkley" width="260">
		<p>Name: Brinkley<br>
		Breed: Labrador Retriever and Border Collie mix<br>
		Age: 5 years old<br>
		Color: Black and white<br>
		Sex: Neutered male<br>
		Weight: 75 pounds</p>
		<p>My name is Brinkley and I'd be a great addition to a home that isn't super busy as all of the activity can make me a little anxious and worried at times. I can be easygoing and can get along with most people, older children and other dogs, so if you have a home with moderate to low traffic, I might be right for you.</p>

		<p>Name: Lucy<br>
		Breed: Dalmatian<br>
		Age: 1 year and 8 months old<br>
		Color: Black and white<br>
		Sex: Spayed female<br>
		Weight: 52 pounds</p>
		<p>Lucy is one of the "Diamond Dogs" here at NHS. Yes, that means that she is a GEM of a dog, she just needs some "polish" & the right "setting" to sparkle as her very best self! Lucy loves to run and play outside. Her previous owners state that she is potty trained and crate trained! Lucy is a shy girl who has a hard time meeting new people. It takes her awhile to warm up, but once she does she will be your best friend!</p>
